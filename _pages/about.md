<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology (ABCT) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

My research harnesses state-of-the-art synchrotron radiation facilities to drive innovation in the full-cycle development of catalysts—from atomically precise synthesis and dynamic characterization to performance optimization. Centered on programmable multinuclear metal clusters within porous materials, I developed a molecular-level design framework to tailor catalytic architectures for energy and sustainability challenges.

To decode structure-activity relationships, I have developed an integrated synchrotron methodology combining X-ray/neutron diffraction (Rietveld refinement), total scattering with atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES/EXAFS), enabling the tracking of electronic-structural dynamics and host-guest synergies under operando conditions.

I have published **42 peer-reviewed papers** (h-index = 15) with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_Gdrw7UAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>1100+</span></strong></a> (<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_Gdrw7UAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
