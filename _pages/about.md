<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>


I am a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology (ABCT) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. 

My research focuses on the rational design and characterization of atomically precise metal clusters in zeolites, including:

- Molecular assembly of multinuclear Cu clusters in ZSM-5
- Dual-atom Cu-M catalysts in hierarchical USY zeolites
- Genome engineering of trinuclear metal clusters in ZSM-5 zeolites

I am interested in structure-activity correlations of supported metal clusters using advanced characterization techniques such as synchrotron X-ray/neutron diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and pair-distribution function (PDF) analysis.

I have published more than 40 papers with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_Gdrw7UAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>1100+</span></strong></a> (<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_Gdrw7UAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
